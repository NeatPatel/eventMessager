# Event Messager Project Blog
This project is an android based Java application that utilizes android studio, email plugins, and sqlite3 as the database to hold reminders for later. The project itself is a reminder app that can be used to create events that can be sent to anyone via email, text, whatsapp, copy paste, or any other form of text communication available as an app on one's phone. 

### Steps:

1. **Setting Up Environment:**
   - Install Android Studio on your development machine.
   - Ensure JDK (Java Development Kit) is properly configured.
   - Create a new Android project in Android Studio.

2. **Designing User Interface (UI):**
   - Sketch out the UI layout for the reminder app, considering usability and aesthetics.
   - Utilize Android Studio's layout editor to create XML layout files for each screen.
   - Implement necessary UI elements such as text fields, buttons, date pickers, etc.

3. **Database Setup:**
   - Integrate SQLite3 as the local database for storing reminder data.
   - Define the database schema, including tables for reminders and any related information.
   - Implement SQLiteOpenHelper class to manage database creation, version management, and access.

4. **Implementing Reminder Functionality:**
   - Develop Java classes to handle reminder creation, editing, deletion, and retrieval.
   - Implement logic to interact with the SQLite database, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
   - Integrate date and time pickers to set reminder schedules.

5. **Adding Communication Options:**
   - Integrate email plugins to allow users to send reminders via email.
   - Implement functionality to send reminders via text messages (SMS), WhatsApp, or any other text communication app available on the device.
   - Enable copying reminder details to the device clipboard for easy sharing through other apps.

6. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Test the application on various Android devices and screen sizes to ensure compatibility.
   - Perform unit testing for individual components and functionality.
   - Utilize Android Studio's debugging tools to identify and fix any issues.

7. **User Experience Enhancements:**
   - Implement features to enhance user experience, such as notifications for upcoming reminders.
   - Include options for customizing reminder preferences, such as sound alerts or recurring reminders.
   - Ensure smooth navigation and intuitive interactions throughout the app.

8. **Optimization and Refinement:**
   - Optimize code for performance and efficiency, considering factors like memory usage and battery consumption.
   - Refine UI elements based on user feedback and usability testing.
   - Continuously update and improve the app based on user suggestions and technological advancements.

9. **Documentation and Deployment:**
   - Create comprehensive documentation covering app functionality, usage instructions, and technical details.
   - Package the application for deployment on the Google Play Store or any other distribution platform.
   - Follow platform-specific guidelines for app submission, including providing necessary metadata and assets.
